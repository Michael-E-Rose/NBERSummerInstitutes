Was it a mistake to think that because international banks dominated the system a run was "unthinkable"? Would it have made a difference if the local banks had been branches of foreign banks, rather than subsidiaries? Is narrow/offshore banking the only long-term option for the future? For the short-term, how does one "thaw out" frozen deposits? 10:45 PMBreak 11:00 AM 2. BANKING Chair: ANDRES VELASCO, New York University and NBER PEDRO POU, former head of central bank of Argentina KRISTIN FORBES, MIT and NBER TED TRUMAN, Institute for International Economics ALBERTO ADES, Goldman Sachs Argentina appeared to be the world's biggest success story for currency boards in the last decade. Should we view the 1991 convertibility plan as having been a success, in hindsight? Does its failure in 2001 mean that hard pegs more generally, or the corners hypothesis, are now discredited worldwide? Was dollarization ever a real option? If so, when was it too late? Is it still an option? Would a hard peg have worked if the link had not been to a currency, the dollar, that on trade grounds was not well-correlated with Argentina's needs? 12:30 PM Lunch - Skyline Suites Lunch speaker: ANNE KRUEGER, First Deputy Managing Director, IMF; Stanford University and NBER 1:45 PM 3. DEBT Chair: SEBASTIAN EDWARDS, UC, Los Angeles and NBER ROQUE FERNANDEZ, former Finance Minister, Argentina RICARDO HAUSMANN, Harvard University ARTURO PORZECANSKI, ABN AMRO MICHAEL MUSSA, Institute for International Economics Should Argentina's fiscal record in the 1990s be viewed as poor, compared to other countries? What was the role of reform of previously unfunded pension liabilities? What was the role of the provinces, and fiscal federalism? Why did the measures taken to smooth out debt maturities, and to arrange private contingent lines of credit, apparently help so little? Was the main problem simply an increase in the interest rate that international investors demanded on Argentine debt and, if so, is this an example of multiple equilibria? 3:15 PM Break 3:30 PM 4. DESPERATION REMEDIES Chair MARTIN FELDSTEIN, Harvard University and NBER RICARDO LOPEZ MURPHY, former Economics Minister, Argentina RANDALL KROSZNER, U.S. Council of Economic Advisors ANOOP SINGH, International Monetary Fund MARIO BLEJER, former head of the Central Bank of Argentina Did Cavallo's attempts to deal with the worsening situation make sense? Was it ever possible to have a relatively painless default? Would a pesification have been considered a default, even if done efficiently? Were Cavallo's desperation measures the best that could be done, or irrelevant, or did they make a bad situation worse? Was it too late to save Argentina, i.e., to avoid devaluation and default, by 2000? What was the IMF's responsibility in the crisis? Did the IMF make the mistake of throwing good money away in August 2001? Was it an accomplice to the government in making people believe -- including politicians -- that there was more money than what there really was? 5:00 PM Adjourn 6:00 PM - Clam Bake at the Harvard Faculty Club, 20 Quincy Street, Cambridge   7/18/02 National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc.
