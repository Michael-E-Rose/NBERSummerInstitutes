Machine-readable structured textfiles showing the program for each workshop, with mild corrections (typos) applied.

Format rules:
- Line TIME _must_ follow immediately after line TITLE
- In sessions with multiple papers, only the first paper receives a start time (line TIME)

We ignore workshops that consist of panels or lectures only.  We applied mild corrections to the time entries, i.e. adjusting "am" and "pm" where appropriate (i.e. there is no talk at 11:00 pm).
